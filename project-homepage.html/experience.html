    <p align="center">
        Talking about my experience you may laugh but it truth what
        I have done and been through.I have done my SEE and +2 from the "Shree SatyaNarayan
        Secondary School" in the Electrical Engineering. As I passsed
        by reading Electrical but after that I realized that I
        am not much intrested in Electrical and due to that reason and
        money problem as well as the suggestion of the Brother named
        "Gokul Khatiwada" I decided to study Computer Engineering in PUSOE.

    <p align="left">Right now as well I dont know much about
        the programming but I am trying my best to build myself.
        I hope I will be succeding in making my own value.
        And thats all. Again I am not writing to get the sympathy
        but to showcase to myself that how far I have came and to 
        remained that I need to keep pushing myself more more more.......
